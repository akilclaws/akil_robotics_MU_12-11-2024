Description on the work done in Mahindra University
Projects based on Course Work (1)
1. Home Automation system 
   * Blueetooth and cloud operated home Automation system to understand the use of various boards such as Arduino, Rasprberry pi, Raspberry pi pico and various sensors such as IR Sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, smoke sensor (MQ), etc...
2. Understanding the purpose of using FOC Controller for Quadruped robot and its need to implement Impedance control
   * FOC Controller allows system to have good control over the Torque as well as speed of the system
3. Simulation of Macpherson strut suspension to analysis the dynamics of the system using joint/body coordinates in x, y coordinates.
